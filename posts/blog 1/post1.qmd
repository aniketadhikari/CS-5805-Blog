## What is Probability Theory?
The outcome of random events like rolling a pair of dice are impossible to predict with absolute certainty. Probability theory provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness in these situations where outcome is not deterministic. 

Under the umbrella of probability theory is a couple of key concepts that I will be going through, such as:

-   Probability
-   Random Variables
-   Probability Distributions 
-   Events and Sample Spaces 
-   Conditional Probability 
-   Independence
-   Bayes' Theorem

# Areas of Importance
1. Science and Engineering

In fields of science such as physics, biology, and engineering, probability theory is essential for modeling random processes like signal processing and particle behavior
