Probability theory provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness in these situations where outcome is not deterministic. \n\nUnder the umbrella of probability theory is a couple of key concepts that I will be going through, such as:\n\n-   Random Variables\n-   Independence\n-   Conditional Probability\n-   Bayes Theorem\n\n# Areas of Importance\n\nProbability theory has proven to be crucial in various fields including, but not limited to: \n\n## Economics\n\nIn economics, probability models are used to forecast certain economic indicators like annual GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates. Through these forecasts, policymakers are able to make informed decisions about the macroeconomy [2]\n\n## Finance \n\nProbability theory is fundamental for assessing risk in financial markets. It has a massive influence on how institutional and individual investors make decisions regarding buying and selling of securities. It also influences the way financial derivatives like options are priced by sellers [2].\n\n## Medicine\n\n3 years ago, the whole world was shut down by COVID-19, which resulted in many people falling ill. In instances like this, epidemiologists utilize predictive algorithms to measure the probability of patients being carriers disease carriers based on symptom screening. By identifying novel cases of COVID-19, there is potential that it can be identified early, which can help to reduce long-term complications and even save lives [3]\n\n# Random Variables \nIn the context of probability theory, a random variable is usually designated as $X$ and can take on different numerical values a as result of random events/experiments. The numerical values associated with the outcome of the event are determined by the underlying probability space[4].[5]. There are 2 types of random variables values: \n\n## Discrete Variable\n**Discrete variables** are variables that can only take on certain discrete, countable values. It is restricted to integers and can not be represented as a decimal or fraction. \n\nExamples:\n- Counts and integers like number of items or scores\n- Binary variables like pass/fail or yes/no \n- Rating scales like rating movies on a 1-5 star scale\n- Event outcomes such as a dice roll or coin flip\n\n## Continuous Variables\n**Continuous variables** are able to take on an infinite number of real values within a range. It can take on fractional or decimal values in addition to integer values.\n\nExamples: \n* Physical measurements like height, weight, temperature\n* Time, geographic coordinates\n* Natural phenomena like air pressure \n\n#  Independence\nIn probability theory, we say that two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurence of one of the events does not effect the probability of the other event. That is, $P(A|B)=P(A)$ and $P(B|A)=P(B)$. \n\nFor independent events, the probability of both occuring is the product of their respective probabilities. That is, $P(A \\cap B)=P(A)*P(B)$\n\nIndependence can be used to determine whether the probability of one event is dependent on the outcome of another or not. Events that are not independent are dependent, meaning the occurence of one event influences the outcome of another. In statists, we want samples to be independent so we don't introduce bias.\n\nAn example of independence would be a coin flip.  If we were to flip 2 coins, the outcome of one of the coins is not going to effect the other since they are independent. Another example would be rolling a pair of dice. The outcome of one dice does not affect another pair.\n\n# Conditional Probability\nConditional probability refers to the measure of probability of an event $A$ occuring, given an another event $B$ has already occured. That us, $P(A|B)$. \n\nAn example of conditional probability would be the probability that someone has the flu, given they are coughing. \n\n# Bayes' Theorem\nBayes' Theorem is a formula that is used to calculate conditional probabilities. Essentially, it describes the probability of an event $A$, given that there is some new information $B$. That is, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$. \n\nBayes' Theorem is really useful in Machine Learning and statistics since it is used to update probability distributions based on observed data. \n\n# Application\nWe start off by importing `pandas`, which will allow us to extract, aggregate, and analyze our data. We also need to import   `matplotlib` since we need to visualize the data as well.\n\nThe aesthetic of the visualizations are altered as well. The size of the legend, axis, ticks, and font are all altered. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.rc('font', size=12) # font size \nplt.rc('axes', labelsize=14, titlesize=14) # font size of axis and label titles \nplt.rc('legend', fontsize=12) # font size of legend\nplt.rc('xtick', labelsize=5) # size of ticks on x-axis\nplt.rc('ytick', labelsize=10) # size of ticks on y-axis\n```\n:::\n\n\nI decided to use a dataset from Kaggle of the first 7 generations of Pokemon. Pokemon is a really old video game franchise and essentially any time a new game was made, they would come up new Pokemon. The new Pokemon for the game would comprise of a generation and usually there's around 100 or more Pokemon per generation. This dataset shows basic information about Pokemon such as their names, weight, height, and number in the Pokedex. Additionally, it includes information that can be interesting to analyze when aggregated, such as attack, defense, hit points (HP), generation, if they are considered legendary, and much more.\n\nHere, we are loading the csv file and converting it into a `pandas` Series so that it can be examined. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata_source_raw = \"../../datasets/pokemon.csv\"\ndata_source_result = pd.read_csv(data_source_raw)\ndata_source_result\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style

Here we can figure out what are the odds that a Pokemon from Generation 7 is classified as Legendary?\n\nWe've already imported everything we need, so we need to start by filtering by the generation.

Here we are using the `is_legendary` column because we are evaluating which Pokemon are and aren't legendary. While we could get the count of each, it is probably more meaningful to get percentage breakdowns of them.

As we can see, there is 78.75% non-legendary Pokemon and 21.25% legendary Pokemon in Generation 7.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nlegendary_percentages.plot(kind=\"pie\", ylabel=\"\", title=\"% of Legendary Gen 7 Pokemon\", labels=[\"Not Legendary\", \"Legendary\"], autopct='%.1f%%')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](post1_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.png){width=389 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe could also factor in conditional probablity and Bayes' Theorem. If we were to play a guessing game for every single Pokemon in this dataset, guessing the right Pokemon would be really challenging because there is over 800 Pokemon. We would have only a 0.12% chance of guessing right!\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntotal_num_pokemon = data_source_result['pokedex_number'].count()\n1/total_num_pokemon \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```\n0.0012484394506866417\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut what if we found out that the Pokemon is in Generation 1 and is also a legendary pokemon? That would certainly increase our odds!\n\nHere we can filter for Pokemon that appear in Generation 1, filter for the legendary Pokemon, and then get the count which is 5. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ngen1_pokemon = data_source_result[data_source_result['generation']==1]\nlegendary_gen1 = gen1_pokemon[gen1_pokemon['is_legendary']==1]\nlegendary_gen1_count = legendary_gen1['name'].count()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then do 1 divided by the count to get our new odds. We have improved our guessing odds from 0.1% to 20%!\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n1/legendary_gen1_count \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```\n0.2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis showcasing *Bayes' Theorem*, which suggests bringing in new evidence will effect the outcome of the event. In our case, we found out that the Pokemon we were looking for is in Generation 1 and Legendary. \n\n",
